# Rennan Ferraz

I’m a multidisciplinary professional with over 15 years of experience across
communication, design, data and project management.

Currently, I’m expanding my work as a developer, focusing on building structured,
well-documented digital solutions that connect **business needs, data, design and
technology**.

I don’t approach development as an isolated technical task — I see it as part of
a broader system involving strategy, usability, information clarity and execution.
